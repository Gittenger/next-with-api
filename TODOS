Set up database
- test saving users

Set up auth
- Use 3rd party lib
- Save user info to db
- Only need admin user

Upload images:
- use POST to save images in public folder
- use multer (read article)

Once auth is set up, figure out how to protect route

Need route - GET ALL images

Later:
integrate react carousel gallery

Once all is working, can start migrating FF project to Next serverless format
Eventually, can be uploaded to vercel for free serverless hosting
